## What do we do here

At Mic's we have multiple teams working on the same project.  
We currently have:
- An electronic/IoT team.
- A mobile application team (on iOS and Android).
- A desktop application team (on Linux and Windows).

### How we work

By integrating a team you will become a part of the team's routine: 
- [The way we produce code at Mic's.](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)
- Since the teams are full remote, we do weekly meetings every Tuesday so we can update everyone on our work. The invitation to this meeting will be sent to you shortly.
- We communicate through Discord, please ask anyone in the team so send you an invite to join our server.
- Every feature being developed or any hardware/software PoC must follow our [quality assurance policy](QUALITY_ASSURANCE.md).


## Where is everything

- Documentation and specifications about the project are available in the team's Discord. 
- Source code repositories links are also available in the Discord channel, each project respects [this guide](PROJECT_LIFECYCLE.md). Please ask the administrator of the repository you will be working on to give you the necessary rights if it hasn't been done already.  
- If you have any question, feel free to ask to anyone in the team using the appropriate Discord channel.
